						<h2>NHH Coders @NWERC 2025</h2>
						<p>For the first time
							a team of NHH students participated in 
							the international programming competition
							<a href='https://2025.nwerc.eu/'>NWERC</a>, 
							with 141 teams from 76 institutions in 12 countries,
							hosted at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany.</p>

						<span>The <em>Northwestern European Regional Contest</em> (<a href='https://2025.nwerc.eu/'>NWERC</a>) 2025 
						was the first round of the 50th iteration of the <em>International Collegiate Programming Contest</em> 
						(<a href='https://icpc.global/'>ICPC</a>), 
						the ``oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world''
						[<a href='https://icpc.global/'>ICPC</a>].
						Teams of three students compete in solving a challenging set of problems that require creativity and skills in algorithmic thinking and programming.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						The event lasted an entire weekend. Besides an exciting competition, it gave the students possibilities of meeting other people from different places that share their passion 
						for algorithmic problem solving and programming; both on the contest site and at various social events. 
						At a company market they could connect with the sponsors of the event which were attractive companies mostly (but not only) from the tech and trading sectors, 
						for instance 
						<a href='https://www.huawei.com/en/'>Huawei</a>, 
						<a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/'>Jetbrains</a>, 
						<a href='https://www.janestreet.com/'>Jane Street</a>, 
						<a href='https://www.jumptrading.com/'>Jump Trading</a>, 
						<a href='https://alberblanc.com/'>Àlber Blanc</a>, and 
						<a href='https://www.lorealparis.no/'>L'Oreàl</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The NHH team consisted of Torkil Tallberg, a 2nd-year BEDS student, Ying-Shan Tung, an exchange student from Taiwan, and Kenan Viteskic, a 1st-year MØA student. 
						Coming from all corners of NHH, their common meeting point was NHH Code.
					</p>
					<h4>According to Viteskic:</h4>
					<blockquote>
					NWERC was an amazing experience, both academically and socially. 
					It was challenging in the best possible way — the feeling 
					of finally cracking a difficult problem is something you truly have to experience to understand. 
					I also had the opportunity to meet people from all over Europe with diverse backgrounds, 
					and spending time with them made the weekend pass incredibly quickly.
